# TODO-LIST-APP

i built this app with JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
the list contains an input field where we type in our various list.
the plus(+) sign is used to enter list typed
once list is entered, it automatically adds an oredered numbering to the list
one tap on any list items strikes it out
double tap deletes the item from your list.
